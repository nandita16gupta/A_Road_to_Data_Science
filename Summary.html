# Probability

--

- Cards

    * What is probability of getting one pair of card from a deck of 52 cards? 
--
    3/51
--
    * What is probability of getting two cards in the same suit from a deck of 52 cards? 
--
    12/51
--
    * What’s the probability of getting two cards that are not in the same suit and not a pair from a deck of 52 cards?
--
    36/51
--
- Coins

    * You randomly draw a coin from 100 coins - 1 unfair coin (head-head), 99 fair coins (head-tail) and roll it 10 times. If the result is 10 heads, whats the probability that the coin is unfair?
--

        `\(\frac{1/100}{1/100*1 + 99/100*(1/2)^{10}} = \frac{1024}{1033}\)`

---

# Probability

- Seattle Raining

    You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if you should bring an umbrella. You call 3 random friends of yours who live there and ask each independently if it’s raining. Each of your friends has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining. What is the probability that it’s actually raining in Seattle?
--

    p denotes the probablity of raining at Seattle, then we will have the conditional probablity as
    `$$\frac{(2/3)^3*p}{(2/3)^3*p + (1/3)^3*(1-p)}$$`
--    
    If `\(p = 1/4\)`, we have the answer as 8/11.
