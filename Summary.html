### Statistics
### Coding
### Machine Learning
### Case Studies

---

# SQL

--

- PRIMARY KEY

    * Uniquely identify each record in a database table
    * Cannot contain NULL values
    * Only one PRIMARY KEY
    
--

- FOREIGN KEY 

    * Used to link two tables together
    * Can contain NULL values
    * Refer to the PRIMARY KEY

--

- Structure

    ```
    select ... from ... 
    join ... on ...
    where ...
    group by ... having ... 
    order by ... 
    ```

# SQL

- Content Type

    table: content_id | content_type (comment/ post) | target_id

    * If it is comment, target_id is the user_id who posts it.
    * If it is post, then target_id is NULL.
    
    What is the distribution of comments?

--
    
        ```
        select cnt, count(cnt) as freq
        from
            (select content_id, count(target_id) cnt 
            from table 
            group by content_id) a 
        group by cnt;

# Probability

--

- Cards

    What is probability of getting one pair of card from a deck of 52 cards? 
--
    3/51

--
    What is probability of getting two cards in the same suit from a deck of 52 cards? 
--
    12/51

--
    What’s the probability of getting two cards that are not in the same suit and not a pair from a deck of 52 cards?
--
    36/51
--
- Coins

    You randomly draw a coin from 100 coins - 1 unfair coin (head-head), 99 fair coins (head-tail) and roll it 10 times. If the result is 10 heads, whats the probability that the coin is unfair?
--

    `\(\frac{1/100}{1/100*1 + 99/100*(1/2)^{10}} = \frac{1024}{1033}\)`
        

---

# Probability

- Seattle Raining

    You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if you should bring an umbrella. You call 3 random friends of yours who live there and ask each independently if it’s raining. Each of your friends has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining. What is the probability that it’s actually raining in Seattle?
--

    p denotes the probablity of raining at Seattle, then we will have the conditional probablity as
    `$$\frac{(2/3)^3*p}{(2/3)^3*p + (1/3)^3*(1-p)}$$`
--    
    If `\(p = 1/4\)`, we have the answer as 8/11.

---

# Probability

- Birthday

    There are 30 people in a class. What is the probablity of at least two people who have the same birthday?

--
    Think the opposite the questions about the probablity of all the people who have different birthdays.
    
    `\(P = 1 - \frac{365*364*...*336}{365^{30}}\)`
    
    What is the probabily of that there are exactly two people who have the same birthday? (similar to card problems like suit and pair)

--
    Choose one pair out of 30 people and assign one out of 365 days to their birthday. Then consider the probablity of the rest 28 people who have different birthdays.
    
    `\(P = \frac{\binom{30}{2}*365*364*...*337}{365^{30}}\)`
    
---

# Statistics

- Linear regression
    
    - Assumptions: linearity, independence, homogeneity and normality
    - Inference and interpretation
    - Issues like outlier and multicollinearity
    
- Logistics regression

    - Invalid assumptions compared with linear regression
    - Interpretation
    
- Hypothesis testing

    - p value, `\(H_0\)`, `\(H_1\)`, type I error, type II error, power
    - Confidence intervals
